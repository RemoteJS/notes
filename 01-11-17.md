# RemoteJS Meetup *11 Jan 2017*

Proposed Topics:
* Glenn: GraphQL
* Glenn: `react-fiber`
* Glenn: Static typing
* Jan: Zeit (now, next, Hyper)
* Jan: WebAssembly
* Richard: `react-native`
* React alternatives: Preact, Inferno, Vue, ...
* Chris: Testing
* HMR
* Thomas: RxJS

Discussed Topics:
* 2016 in Review: Chris (short introduction into Meteor)
* Tooling (Webpack vs. meteor; Webpack code splitting for efficient routing; Webpack as successor to task runners?)
* `react-router` (version 3 vs. 4), 
* `recompose` (trivial composition of higher-order components)
* `reselect` (simplification of Redux state, keeping just minimal information)
* truck factor ðŸš›
* `styled-jsx`, CSS components: Why possibly use CSS in JavaScript? Keep CSS independent of JavaScript? (cascading vs. namespacing), `styled-components`
* Glenn: `react-fiber`: Complete rewrite of React core, mainly vdom-diffing. Laggy animations induced by re-rendered components in hierarchy tree are supposed to be fixed (but still highly experimental state)
* async/await vs. futures (async calls within synchronuous environments) (coming from Meteor fibers)
* yarn vs. npm shrinkwrap: Works quite well in production, lockfile (yarn.lock) easily mergeable; yarn tracks sub-package versions; yarn is amazingly fast âš¡
* Static typing: flow vs. TypeScript
  * Glenn tries to use as much flow as possible for smaller modules
  * Michael and Thomas: All code adapted to TypeScript
  * Collections of types: `flow-typed` (https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed), DefinitelyTyped (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
* Testing: Jest? How to approach React testing?
  * Glenn: snapshots & static typing do lot of work beforehand (https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react.html#snapshot-testing)
  * JavaScript without typing is more of a fear-driven development.
  * Don't over-test (huge payload, overhead when making changes); Richard: focus on acceptance- and e2e-tests
  * Automated testing: Chimp (https://chimp.readme.io/)
* Chris: How to test recompose-HOCs?

Deferred Topics:
* Server-side rendering (https://prerender.io/; Google execution of JavaScript?)
* Hot module replacement (HMR)
* GraphQL
* `react-native`
