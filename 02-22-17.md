# RemoteJS Meetup *22 Feb*

Ideas from last meetup (11 Jan):
* Server-side rendering (https://prerender.io/; Google execution of JavaScript?)
* Hot module replacement (HMR)
* GraphQL
* `react-native`

Ideas ahead:
* Animations in react. Does it have to be so hard? (Chris)
* Conference plans for this year. Are we going to meet somewhere? Do we need T-Shirts :airplane:? (Chris)
* Progressively loading of websites? (Jan)
* OSS funding (webpack-like) (Jan)

Introductions: Hi, Raul! Hi, Karl!

prerender.io:
* Issues with routing on statically requested websites: /, ? or #. Michael's approach: Use ? as in-between

Instability of APIs in the JavaScript ecosystem (e.g., compared to win32 API)
* Missing documentation, not even a standard in npm
* TypeScript: Browsing code gets a lot easier (Michael)
* Chris: Just getting used to it; browsing unobtrusive code is lifestyle
* Thomas: TypeScript is a huge lifesaver for large codebases. Omits a lot of tests, like typos
* Jan: JavaScript has nice paradigms and can be written quite readable, and Flow conflicted there with me
* TypeScript is nice for libraries; decreases learning curves for new developers

Progressively loading websites:
* Dynamically loading contents (images, JS bundles), 
* https://www.ampproject.org: Constraints of tags, contents etc., but huge loading improvements
* Chris: Having a talk on progressively loading web apps!
* HTTP/2: Issues with push (what's in the cache? ðŸŒ©)
* Ipfs: Latency-optimized, somewhat similar to BitTorrent (but: no leeching in Ipfs!)
* Dr. Aron Fischer might join us? ðŸ˜» (Colony is using Ipfs actually, instead of some CDN-like content)
* Jan: Upspin (https://upspin.io)
* Chris: Deferred all info on Swarm/Ipfs onto Dr. Fischer (but shortly elaborated  on howto Colony works with Ethereum and uses Smart Contracts)

Chris: Elm has great concepts, some are similar to `saga` (https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)

Jan: Webpack funding; how to (if, at all?) appraoch OSS funding?
* Chris: https://hueniverse.com/2015/08/15/converting-full-time-pay-to-hourly-contract-rate/ (dangerous)
* Michael: Heartbleed, for example. SSL didn't have the developer capacities to get around these bugs
* Shiny stuff attracts more developers; fundamental projects may have struggles
* Issue with working full-time on something; how to feed a family?
* https://twitter.com/jlongster/status/819978179586756608
* "Software is expensive"

Glenn: Documentation-driven development?
* "Clean Code" https://books.google.de/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=dwSfGQAACAAJ&redir_esc=y
* Michael: Types!, IDEs
* Maybe elaborate more approaches to overcome documentation & types, but rather a (r)evolutionary approach?

Conferences
* Karl and Glenn are attending react-europe
* Chris is probably going to NordicJS and/or reactiveConf
* Raul is going to react-conf amsterdam

*From now on*: Everyone is encouraged to share her/his link of the month!

Ideas for next meetup:
* Crypto-Ethereum-Special feat. Dr. Aron Fischer?
* react-intl
* Intro to sagas?
