# RemoteJS Meetup *16 Mar 2017*

Aron about Swarm:
* Swarm: Resilient, incentive, distributed (decentralized) storage network based on Ethereum (?)
* ... 
* Incentive: BitTorrent has seeders, but they aren't rewarded by the system. Swarm however is incentive, rewarding seeders and kind of guarantees proper availability
* S3 vs. Swarm: Swarm is intended to be fail-tolerant, able to reconstruct files
* "You can't delete something on Swarm"
* Fuse driver: Mount Swarm storage as it was a filesystem
* Swarm is re-duplicating (using Git-like deltas?)
* Finding data via routing networks
* Offering data via public gateways (any client accessing Swarm data has to have the swarm client installed) (http://swarm-gateways.net/)
* In Swarm/Ethereum, content is immutableâ€”but names (hash references?) aren't
* Demo Video: http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/swarmdemo.test/

Post-discussion:
* Hi, Thiago, Andrea and Haiko!
* How do Colony's web services and Ethereum/Swarm integrate?

* ReactConf 2017: Less React Native, some Fiber, Reason, code splitting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb6RCrDaxhw&index=4&list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1_fTtjoeSbiIXeia9aYxB1
* Reason: Based on OCaml, JavaScript-ized, compiled language, being able to use Reason with React

Vue.js (Haiko has worked with it)
* HTML mixed with template code and special directives (`v-if`, ...)
* Special directives optional; after all it's just JavaScript in the end
* Redux support built-in

What's this actually about?
* Meetup for remote workers (getting to Meetups is hard when doing travel)
* Prepare talks?
* Watching talks as group, discussing it
* "Mob-programming" http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/06/01/mob-programming/

* Glenn demonstrated `react-countup`, his OSS project (a React component using Countup.js)
* `react-router` v3 vs v4
